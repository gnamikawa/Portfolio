Welcome reader to another interesting and informative blog. This blog will provide an overview of what TypeScript is and how you can get up and running using Typescript.

## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript. It can be used with any browser or operating system since in the end the code that gets sent to the browser is just Javascript. TypeScript can also be used with Node.js or in any JavaScript engine that supports ECMAScript 3 (or newer).

TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript. But type checking is what makes TypeScript a very powerful tool that allows you to scale your application.

JavaScript is an interpreted language. Hence, it needs to be run in order to check that everything is valid. It means you write all the code just to find no output when an error occurs and many times Javascript will not provide an error message. This results in you having to spend hours trying to find the bug(s) in your code. The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. This helps to highlight errors before the script is run, thus saving you time and many headaches.

## How to get started.
The first step needed in order to use Typescript is to install it globally on your computer by using NPM (Node Package Manager). In case you are new to NPM, to use it you need to have Node.js installed on your computer (for help with Node.js installation click here). To check what version of Node.js and NPM you have just enter the following commands on your terminal:

```js
node -v
npm -v
```

After making sure that you Node.js installed in your computer, enter this command on your terminal:

```js
npm i -g typescript
```

This will install TypeScript globally allowing you to use it within any project that you have on your computer. We are now going to create a very simple project using TypeScript. Below you will see an image of the file structure of our project.
